ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Abhinna Manandhar. I am currently studying BSc(Hons.) Computing from Coventry University.
I am keen to learn more and am gaining experience in the field of programming and computer science.
I have a fundamental knowledge on Python, Java and php.
Also, I am parallelly learning about about data in my spare time.

Additionally, reading and playing video games are some of my hobbies.

I am looking for opportunities and experiences and I love to explore new things.
